# SALINE-MOINITORING-SYSTEM

During recent years, due to the technological advancements many sophisticated 
techniques has been evolved for assuring fast recovery of the patients in hospitals. Need 
for good patient care in hospitals, assessment and management of fluid and electrolyte is 
the most fundamental  thing required. All most in all hospital, an assist/nurse is responsible 
for monitoring the Glucose bottle level. But unfortunately most of the time, the observer 
may forget to change the saline bottle at correct time due to their busy schedule. To 
overcome this critical situation, a GSM based automatic alerting and indicating device is 
proposed where weight sensor is used as a level sensor. It is based on the principle that the 
IR sensor output voltage level changes when intravenous fluid level is below certain limit. 
A comparator is used to continuously compare the message output with predefined 
threshold. When the transceiver output is negative then the Arduino controller identifies 
the fluid level is too low and it alerts the observer through the mounted LCD display and 
mobile phone at the control room indicates the room number of the patient for quick 
recovery.
